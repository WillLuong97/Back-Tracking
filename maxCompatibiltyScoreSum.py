#Problem 1947. Maximum Compatibility Score Sum

'''
There is a survey that consists of n questions where each question's answer is either 0 (no) or 1 (yes).
The survey was given to m students numbered from 0 to m - 1 and m mentors numbered from 0 to m - 1. The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array students where students[i] is an integer array that contains the answers of the ith student (0-indexed). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array mentors where mentors[j] is an integer array that contains the answers of the jth mentor (0-indexed).
Each student will be assigned to one mentor, and each mentor will have one student assigned to them. The compatibility score of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.
For example, if the student's answers were [1, 0, 1] and the mentor's answers were [0, 0, 1], then their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.
You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to maximize the sum of the compatibility scores.
Given students and mentors, return the maximum compatibility score sum that can be achieved.
 
Example 1:
Input: students = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]], mentors = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 8
Explanation: We assign students to mentors in the following way:
- student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.
- student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
- student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
The compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.
Example 2:
Input: students = [[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]], mentors = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The compatibility score of any student-mentor pair is 0.
 
Constraints:
m == students.length == mentors.length
n == students[i].length == mentors[j].length
1 <= m, n <= 8
students[i][k] is either 0 or 1.
mentors[j][k] is either 0 or 1.
 	      0    1      2
students = [[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]]
            0      1     2
mentors = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
Return: the biggest compatibility sum between the students and tutors. 
Observation: 
- To retrieve the maximum sum of the score, we must choose the biggest sum of score of each pairing
_ Any students can be paired with any tutors, as long as the pairing return the highest compatibility sum 
Solution: 
check the combatibilty of each student with each metors
 
student -0: mentor 0, 1, 2 => max(compatibleScore)
student -1: mentor 0 ,1, 2 => max(compatibleScore)
student -2: mentor 0 ,1, 2 => max(compatibleScore)
at student  0 with mentor 0
